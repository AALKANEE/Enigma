# Enigma Machine Simulation in Python

This project is a Python simulation of the Enigma machine, a cipher device used by the Germans during World War II. The Enigma machine was renowned for its complex encryption method, which was eventually broken by Allied cryptographers. This Python implementation allows you to encode and decode messages using a simplified version of the Enigma machine.

## Features

- **Rotors**: Three rotors are implemented, each with configurable wiring and notch positions.
- **Reflector**: A single reflector that returns the signal back through the rotors.
- **Plugboard**: A configurable plugboard for swapping letter pairs before and after the rotors.
- **User Input**: The program allows the user to input a message for encryption.

## Getting Started
